# WebScraper 🌐
### Introduction
The goal of my WebScraper program is to conclude work at a point where the python run file is able to navigate LinkedIn and apply for jobs based on a few parameters given by the user. I am currently using the selenium library and may also use more in the future to implent features such as sending a confirmation email or message. - 📨
### Features 
So far the release runs up till the point of the job section on linkedin, you navigate page by page just by keying enter and the program will slowly load each page. Within the code you need to feed the "job_search.sign_form()" two parameters of your email and password on line 79. Later I will prompt the user to type in these details instead of having to code them in. - 👤
### Working on
In the next update I plan to make the program able to apply to jobs on LinkedIn with the simplest of requirements (Easy apply, with easy forms). - 🏢
## Bugs
There are quite a few, mainly to do with the simplicity of the code not trying/excepting. The code currently runs with a bit of help however will throw some error messages, that being said make sure selenium is installed on your device and as long as your internet connection is fine you'll be too! FYI THE BEST LINK/only link that works IS "https://www.linkedin.com/". - 🐛
